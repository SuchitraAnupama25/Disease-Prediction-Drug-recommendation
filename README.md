# ðŸ§  Disease Prediction and Drug Recommendation System

A **Machine Learning + Deep Learningâ€“based web application** that predicts the **most probable disease** from user-input symptoms and recommends the **appropriate drug or treatment** using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model.


**Project Overview**
This project leverages **Deep Learning (ANN)** to predict diseases based on input symptoms and provide accurate **drug recommendations**.  
It combines the power of **Flask (for deployment)**, **TensorFlow/Keras (for model building)**, and **NumPy/Pandas (for data preprocessing)**.
The system is trained on a **custom-built dataset of 72 diseases and 56 symptoms**, with over **100 drug recommendations** mapped to the predicted conditions.


**Key Features**
âœ… Predicts disease from a set of user-provided symptoms  
âœ… Suggests the most relevant drug or treatment  
âœ… Lightweight Flask-based web interface  
âœ… Trained using a Deep Learning (ANN) model  
âœ… Custom dataset created manually for realistic accuracy  
âœ… Modular structure for easy future upgrades
